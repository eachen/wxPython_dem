"""
NOTE: This worked when it was written, but not with recent (2.9)
      versions of wxPython. I suspect that it would have to be re-factored
      to put the GUI in the main thread, and star a secondary thread to
      interact with the user.

Demo of how to drive a wxPython app from another script:

one thread to do the driving, one thread to run the Calculator:

the primary thread runs the GUI - - it gets "locked up" with the mainloop.

the secondary thread is used to do things outside the GUI. In this
case, a simple pause and sending commands now and then. The commands are put
on the event loop with a wx.CallAfter() call.
