    A Buffered window class.

    To use it, subclass it and define a Draw(DC) method that takes a DC
    to draw to. In that method, put the code needed to draw the picture
    you want. The window will automatically be double buffered, and the
    screen will be automatically updated when a Paint event is received.

    When the drawing needs to change, you app needs to call the
    UpdateDrawing() method. Since the drawing is stored in a bitmap, you
    can also save the drawing to file by calling the
    SaveToFile(self,file_name,file_type) method.
